# Why

We need to minimise the friction caused by misunderstandings between the software development team and those responsible for the software requirements by proposing an innovative approach to software specification. The **Behaviour-Driven Development** technique promotes a shared understanding and holds each stakeholder — the product owner, software engineer and test engineer — accountable for the quality of the delivered increments.
