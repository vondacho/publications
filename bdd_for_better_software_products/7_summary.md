# Summary

## Outcomes

- A **common understanding** of expected system behaviour expressed in a domain-oriented ubiquitous language.
- The enhanced probability that **the implemented thing is the right one**.
- Human-readable, **contractual and executable specification** directly usable by every actor of the development team.
- Scenario-based, use-case-driven and domain-driven **documentation of system behaviour**.
- Scenario-based organisation and **monitoring of feature development**.
- Innovation brought to the **tester role** means the QA engineer can now have a significant impact on development.

## Costs
- Time: to attend, organise and facilitate Example mapping meetings
- Time: to learn one new technique
- Time: to learn how to write BDD scenarios
- Time: to set up a BDD framework
- Time: to craft reusable glue code and test code
- Time + Money: to maintain Gherkin phrasing, glue code and test code

*This technique should yield a sustainable investment in product quality.*
