### ANALYSTS, ARCHITECTS, SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS

The craftsman applies himself or herself to his or her work; he or she shows passion and determination in the search for the ideal form.

> Work on the shape until nothing can be removed or added to it.
> The form has reached, through the transparency of its expression, its own existence. It is autonomous.
> A shape must be coherent in its three dimensions and function. Bernhard Müller – artisan bijoutier – [www.bernhard-muller.ch](www.bernhard-muller.ch)

During the analysis, design, and implementation of a software product, he/she follows a cycle of iterations, integrating best practices, principles, and patterns. The ideal shape must comply with design criteria applied at multiple levels, from specification to code, architecture, and testing. It must be understandable and easily extended by other actors. Continuous improvement, application, and altruism are the cornerstones of this artisanal spirit.
