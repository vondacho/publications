## Clean Code - Serenity and economy

![](image3.jpeg)

This article is primarily aimed at software developers, but the form remains readable for business analysts and management actors; they will understand the importance of quality code at the company level and their role as quality agents or influencers.

### Digital accelerator

Software code is a fundamental element of a modern company's operations. Business processes have become definitively dependent on software components that automate all or part of manual activities. Software is an integral part of the company’s success and must meet expectations by being an accelerator and not a digital retarder. Finally, the software works with software code produced by one or more software development teams.

### The truth

In an agile environment, feature documentation is usually non-exhaustive and limited to the essentials. Indeed, collaborative analysis of requirements is facilitated by focusing on interactions between stakeholders: domain experts and software technicians. As the pace of change does not allow for regular maintenance of this even light documentation, the software code naturally becomes the repository of the truth about the system's behaviour, eventually becoming the most reliable source of information.
    
### In motion

The reality of the digital market demands accelerated demand and the ability to deliver value or incremental value from digital products continuously. Software code must therefore have intrinsic qualities that allow it to adapt and evolve. Clarity and organisation of software code are essential levers to reduce change inertia or the magnitude of change during maintenance.
    
### Advantage or burden

For a software development team, for a digital company, software code is usually experienced as an advantage or a burden, an asset or a debt, a sustainable base of opportunities or a cost centre. Quality software code is a recognised ingredient to combine serenity and economy.
    
### Social

Software code is the result of joint analysis, design, and implementation work among several responsible business and technical actors.

It is also an essential emotional source; a well-designed code creates a positive, stimulating and reassuring feeling when reading or reviewing it because the author’s intentions are quickly understood and future extension work can be considered calmly; a sense of excitement when the effects of change are minimal, which naturally induces an additional motivation to sustain the acquired quality.

When writing software code, the author’s empathy towards receivers and future writers is a sign of kindness and professionalism.
    
### Sustainable software development

Optimising writing time, developing more calmly and ensuring constant productivity are the effects of the desired evolution in the way software code is designed. Do no longer develop simply to deliver, but opt for sustainable development. Favour collaborative practices of analysis, design, and writing. There are accessible and adapted solutions to address this objective.
    
### Well-crafted code and interactivity

Clean Code refers to quality software code and editorial practices that are entirely under the control of the software developers and can be configured as desired. It is a question of collectively defining principles of writing and software design, of thinking before coding, of sharing reflections, and of asking for feedback. The code does not belong to anyone; it belongs to the company. We must now think of “community”.

Well-crafted code can be defined by the following intrinsic qualities:
<ul>
  <li>Readability</li>
  <li>Maintainability</li>
  <li>Self-documentation</li>
  <li>Testability</li>
</ul>
